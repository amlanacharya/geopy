# Find My Laptop - Project Report

## Executive Summary

The "Find My Laptop" project is a comprehensive device tracking system designed to help users locate and secure their devices. This application provides a secure, self-hosted solution with features such as real-time location tracking, geofencing capabilities, location history, and device management through a responsive web interface. The primary goal of this project is to develop a privacy-focused alternative to commercial tracking solutions that gives users full control over their data.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Device theft and loss continue to be significant concerns for individuals and organizations. While commercial tracking solutions exist, they often come with privacy concerns, subscription fees, and limited customization options. There is a need for an open, secure, and self-hosted tracking solution that can be deployed in educational and organizational environments without compromising user privacy or requiring ongoing costs.

### 1.2 Project Objectives

- Develop a client-server tracking application that securely monitors device locations
- Implement a robust user authentication system with security best practices
- Create an intuitive web-based dashboard for device management
- Build a lightweight client application to run on tracked devices
- Incorporate geofencing capabilities with alert potential
- Provide location history visualization for tracked devices
- Ensure data privacy through a self-hosted approach

### 1.3 Scope

The project encompasses both server and client components:

- **Server**: A Flask-based web application with a secure user interface, database storage, and API endpoints
- **Client**: A Python application that runs on tracked devices to report location data
- **Features**: User registration/login, device management, location tracking, geofencing, and location history

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

The system follows a client-server architecture with the following components:

1. **Server Component**: Flask-based web application providing user interfaces and API endpoints
2. **Client Component**: Python application for location reporting installed on tracked devices
3. **Database**: SQLite database for data storage
4. **Front-end**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the user interface

### 2.2 Database Schema

The system uses an SQLite database with the following structure:

- **Users Table**: Stores user credentials and authentication information
  - id (primary key)
  - username
  - password (hashed)
  - salt

- **Devices Table**: Stores information about registered devices
  - id (primary key)
  - user_id (foreign key to Users)
  - device_name
  - device_type
  - registered_date

- **Locations Table**: Stores location history for devices
  - id (primary key)
  - device_id (foreign key to Devices)
  - latitude
  - longitude
  - ip_address
  - city
  - region
  - country
  - timestamp

- **Geofences Table**: Stores geofencing information for alerts
  - id (primary key)
  - device_id (foreign key to Devices)
  - latitude
  - longitude
  - radius
  - name

### 2.3 Communication Flow

1. **User Registration/Login**: Users register and log in through the web interface
   - Registration creates a new user record with salted password hash
   - Login validates credentials and establishes a session
   - CSRF tokens are generated for form protection

2. **Device Registration**:
   - Manual: Users can manually register devices through the web interface
     - User fills out device name and type in the modal form
     - CSRF-protected request is sent to the server
     - Server creates a new device record associated with the user
   - Automatic: Client applications can register devices programmatically
     - Client sends username, password, hostname, and OS info
     - Server authenticates user and creates/retrieves device record
     - Server returns device ID to the client for future communications

3. **Location Updating**:
   - The client periodically collects location data
     - Primary method: IP-based geolocation using external APIs
     - Fallback mechanism if primary method fails
     - Location data includes coordinates, IP, and geographic info
   - The client sends location updates to the server API
     - HTTP POST request to `/api/update_location` endpoint
     - Device ID included for identification
     - Automatic re-registration if device ID not recognized
   - The server stores location updates in the database
     - New record in locations table with timestamp
     - Geofence checking triggered on each update

4. **Device Monitoring**:
   - Users view device locations through the web dashboard
     - Interactive map using Leaflet.js
     - Markers for device locations
     - Circles for geofence boundaries
   - The server checks for geofence violations
     - Haversine formula calculates distance between points
     - Alert generated if device outside geofence radius
     - Potential for notification system in future versions
   - Users can view location history for any device
     - Tabular display of past locations with timestamps
     - Geographic information when available
